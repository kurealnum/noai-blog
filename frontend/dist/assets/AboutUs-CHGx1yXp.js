From the spring of 2023, to the spring of 2024, I spent a lot of time on Dev.to (and I still do – it’s a wonderful platform). Somewhere along the way, it occurred to me that the biggest issue Dev.to had wasn’t hateful people, a lack of moderation, accessibility, or anything else. The biggest issue Dev.to had was the influx of AI generated content. ChatGPT was just getting big, and no one had any idea what to do about it. However, I had a few ideas that I organized and shared as a research paper (which I also submitted for my AP English final – a win-win), and thus, the idea of byeAI was born. Since mid-August of 2024, I’ve been chugging along, one AI-free commit at a time. I hope you enjoy this project! If you’d like to give any feedback, please feel free to reach out. You can find contact information on the"," ",e.jsx(a,{to:"/guidelines",children:"guidelines"})," page."]})]})}export{o as default};
